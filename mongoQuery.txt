])


Mongo Query 4:
Write Mongo query to find the average total of orders made by customers who live in California(CA).
The answer should be a with a key avgTotal and it's value should Integer not a Float.

      foreignField: "customer_id",

    }
  },
  {

      "address.state": "CA"
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      total: { $sum: "$orders.total" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  {

    }
  }
])


Mongo Query 5:

  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
])



Mongo Query 6:
Write Mongo query to retrieve the ship_date and order_date of an order whose payment status is pending by payment _id.
Hint: use MongoDB aggregation pipeline with $match, $lookup, $project, $unwind
ANS : db.payments.aggregate([

      paymentstatus: "pending"
    }
  },
  {

  },
  {
    $unwind: "$order"
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      ship_date: "$order.ship_date",
      order_date: "$order.order_date"
    }
  }
])
